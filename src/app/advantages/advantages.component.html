    1. Excellent Omnichannel Experiences
    A CMS was originally built with websites in mind and at the time, that was sufficient. However, as technology began to shift from desktop and mobile to different devices, like smartwatches, voice-activated devices, and other forms of IoT, new delivery layers needed to be created, which made content uploads more burdensome for both developers and marketers. Additionally, since a traditional CMS’s purpose was to manage content for websites, and modern customers interact and access information on so many other channels, this traditional system is no longer enough for the modern customer experience. However, headless helps circumvent these problems.
    
    Take Liferay DXP as an example. Since the content management in Liferay DXP is decoupled, business users can manage, upload, and edit content and content pages conveniently with no involvement from developers. This not only gives non-technical users more control over their content, it also accelerates the process for delivery. This division also makes it easier to achieve brand consistency throughout, especially since businesses need to have the ability to push content into many different channels such as mobile apps, digital signage, kiosks, smartwatches, etc. Due to the decoupling of content authoring and content delivery, enterprises have the flexibility to build engaging experiences regardless of presentation layer, which is extremely critical for delivering seamless and consistent customer experiences across all channels, even future ones.
    
    This is extremely beneficial in building omnichannel experiences for your customers. Successful omnichannel marketing can contribute to higher customer satisfaction rates and retention rates, which can help to generate an increase in annual income.
    
    Why Headless CMS is Integral for Scaling Customer Experiences
    With an ever-increasing number of channels, it’s easier than ever to reach customers. However, organisations need to ask whether the sheer quantity of digital touch points could be affecting the quality of the customer experience.

    2. Flexibility in the Type of CMS Solution
    Because headless CMSs decouple presentation and content, they provide the best of both a traditional CMS and headless architecture in one platform. Enterprises have the freedom to choose which type of CMS solution best fits their needs: traditional, headless, or hybrid. While a fully headless CMS allows content to be pushed to any presentation layer, it can present challenges to non-technical marketers due to a lack of editing capabilities they may be used to. A hybrid CMS such as Liferay DXP can help alleviate this issue with pre-built front-end tools that use APIs to connect with back-end systems. This gives marketers the convenience and familiarity of editing tools and templates to publish content and campaigns to relevant front-end environments.
    
    3. Developer Support
    Liferay’s foundation as a developer platform continues to evolve with the addition of headless APIs for out-of-the-box services. Liferay’s API layer supports the OpenAPI specification, the most popular open source framework for RESTful APIs. Front-end developers can leverage their native tools and frameworks they’re already familiar with to build sites. They also now have unmatched flexibility to integrate Liferay across all systems, which includes pulling data into Liferay or bringing Liferay into an existing ecosystem. Empower your developers to create differentiated customer experiences for every channel with content management APIs, content delivery APIs, content participation APIs, and other REST APIs.
    
    4. Speed and Ease for Developers
    The beauty of an open headless CMS from Liferay is the way it saves developers time by minimising hassles that come with proprietary platforms. You can pick your programming language of choice, and being API driven, you can build your presentation layer and front-end with ease. Developers can develop the way they’re used to without having to conform to proprietary platform limitations. Furthermore, a single content item can be reused and combined with several different presentation outputs, allowing for projects to be completed faster. A headless CMS allows easy and secure integrations with any of your existing systems. This includes the use of webhooks. A webhook is user-defined by an HTTP callback (or small code snippets linked to a web application) that trigger action specific events. A prime example of a webhook is triggering an email to your user once they have paid for a subscription on your site.
