    1. Creating and editing content
    As a minimum requirement, your CMS should let you easily create, edit, and publish content. The easier it is to use, the more time you’ll have to concentrate on your strategy.
    
    2. Workflows, reporting, and content organization
    Are there a lot of people involved in producing your content? Make sure your CMS can track the details of your content from start to finish, from authoring, editing, and approval to publication, promotion, and reporting.
    
    The ability to customize and control workflows within your CMS will help everyone work together smoothly and stay on track with deadlines. And with features like intelligent reporting tools and dashboards, you’ll be able to keep tabs on different categories of content, like content that’s awaiting approval and content per topic.
    
    If you often make urgent updates to your content, look for a CMS with strong organizational functionality, like link management, so that your content is automatically accessible even as it moves around or changes on your site.
    
    3. User and role-based administration
    Having control over who can access content and features will help you prevent mistakes. Choose a CMS with customizable user administration, including room to expand as your needs change.
    
    Ensuring your chosen solution allows for role-based rights will help you scale as you grow, as it enables you to manage access for groups of people instead of individuals.
    
    4. Security
    Imagine this: you’ve worked hard to refine your digital strategy and build personalized relationships with your customers, only to wake up one day to discover there’s been a security breach. Protecting your data and your customers’ data will help you retain trust in the products and services you offer.
    
    Some CMSs integrate with strong authentication mechanisms to beef up security and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Make sure your CMS integrates well with your chosen enterprise security provider or third-party authentication systems.
    
    5. Multichannel scalability
    Delivering content to many different channels, devices, and interfaces can mean a lot of work — unless you have a headless CMS that helps you do that efficiently.
    
    A headless CMS separates content from its presentation. Content is created once, then rendered on any device or channel.
    
    Certain CMSs let you create your content once and deliver it anywhere. Others make it easy to add new channels and simply load your existing content onto them. If your organization is looking to reach customers across many digital channels, prioritizing multichannel scalability features is a smart move.
